## Malaria Detection CNN | Keras

The Dataset for classification problem is taken from the [official NIH Website](https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/).

And you can find it in [kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria).

The dataset contains 27,558 images separated into two folders Infected - Uninfected
