## Malaria Detection CNN | Keras

The Dataset for classification problem is taken from the [official NIH Website](https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/).

And you can find it in [kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria).

The dataset contains 27,558 images separated into two folders Infected - Uninfected

### Inspiration

- Malaria is spread in 106 countries where more than half of the world's population lives.
- Each year, 210-250 million people become infected with malaria, according to the World Malaria Report. At the beginning of the XXI century, this number increased annually by 16%.
- Malaria is in fifth place in the number of deaths per year among infectious diseases.
- Each year, about 30,000 people visiting dangerous areas become infected with malaria
- About 1 million people die from malaria every year.

### What we need to solve the problem:

- Initial step
  - git init
  - import libraries
  - etc
- Data processing
  - Plotting random images
  - Split data
  - Define resizing if it needed
- Build the model
  - Build a network
  - Run it
  - Plot acc and loss
  - Repeat
- Evaluate on test data

As a result, we have 97% of accuracy.
